### Updates

I have just finished a long meeting with Dr. Renert - long story short, we will be changing how we will be proceeding with the remaining units. Very soon, we will be moving on to Integral Calculus, rather than going back to cover the AP material we skipped. When we are doing Integral Calculus, we will focus on Math 31 material, then have a Math 31 test. Following this test, Math 31 is effectively finished, and we will go back to pick up all the AP material we skipped, including integral calculus-specific material. On Friday, we will continue with the AP units we skipped, starting with linearization this week.

I wanted to clarify something we did in class that I spoke about, but didn't write down explicitly: the derivative of arccos(cos x) is only for sure 1 on the interval [0,&pi;], where we're using the restricted domain. I want to emphasize that this is not the "true" derivative in the most general sense, which is actually 1 on the interval [2&pi;n,&pi;+2&pi;n], and is -1 otherwise. I leave as an exercise to see why, either using the chain rule or reducing the argument in arccos(cos x) and using reflection identities. We'll talk more about this at a later time, when we get into AP calculus material.

<b>NOTICE:</b> Master Aaron has changed the deadline of the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/Challenges/2020-21Winter_Break.pdf"> Winter Break math challenges </a> to Dec. 31.

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "AP Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays (Room 2409/2410) as a mandatory period for those who are pursuing AP Calculus this year or next year. This gives us an additional period of instruction every week, since we are behind schedule. Should we get back on track with my desired schedule, I will turn this into an optional period.

<!--
<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays in my zoom room. Please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others.

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 8 on Choice Fridays (location TBD). Please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others. 


<b>NOTICE:</b> The Renert Tutoring Centre is running help sessions via zoom for this class. See Schoology for details.

<!--
Section 3.5 corrections:
  * Q8 should be 20 &#215; 3^(1/4) ~ 26.32, not 20/sqrt(3) ~ 11.55.
  * Q15 is technically incorrect: the question tells you the plane is 20 km from Quinton, so that should mean direct distance (indeed, you are looking for the rate of change of the distance, which they are assuming means direct distance). If you assume the 20 km refers to horizontal distance (but you're trying to find the rate of change of direct distance still). then their answer is correct, 240 &#215; sqrt(5). However, the correct interpretation should yield 300 &#215; sqrt(3). If I were to use a question like this on a test, I would explicitly state "when it is 20 km horizontally from Quinton" vs "when it is directally 20 km away from Quinton" or something to that effect.
